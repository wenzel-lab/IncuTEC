# IncuTEC
Thermoelectric cooling (Peltier stack) based incubator design with gas controll. The temperature controll assembly is inspired by the incubators in the Prakash Lab and expanded to futher uses and gas controll.

The incubator is designed to hold the SQUID microscope (https://github.com/wenzel-lab/SQUID-bioimaging-platform) or optical instruments with a similar footprint. Here you can find an example of such an enclosure https://forum.squid-imaging.org/t/assembly-guide-for-inverted-system-with-the-60-mm-x-60-mm-stage/51. 

## Bill of Materials:
* TEC driver/controller http://yexian.com/product/tcm_standard.htm with PID auto-tuning (can be purched from Heidstar)
* Powerful air-air TEC stack with heatsinks and fans https://www.mouser.cl/ProductDetail/Laird-Thermal-Systems/387000612?qs=uwxL4vQweFP51dqtRIyGCw%3D%3D

* The enclosure could be based just on acrylics or on styrofoam (2" thick boxes like these https://www.uline.com/BL_2157/Insulated-Shipping-Kits)
