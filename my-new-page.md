## Gluing and sealing walls {pagestep}

Position the plates accordingly, ensuring a 90Â° angle between them.Using the syringe, inject the
adhesive liquid between the plates you want to join, waiting for it to bond before moving on to the next plate. Once all the plates
are bonded, use a rod to add the previously diluted acrylic to each of the joints. Ensure that the mixture covers each section of the
joints to prevent leaks.

## Preparation of the screw cubes {pagestep}
Place the nuts in the hexagonal holes according to the hole dimensions. Using a syringe,
inject resin into the three notches for each nut. Apply UV light to cure the resin and secure the nuts in place.

>! Be careful that the resin applied is only injected into the indicated notches. Avoid using excess resin that could affect the nut thread.

## Gluing the screw cubes {pagestep}
Apply glue suitable for gluing screw cubes to acrylic walls (such as cyanoacrylate). Cover the contact surface so that the product does not affect the nuts. Position the block in the correct place, applying pressure while gluing it properly.

>! Ensure that the holes in the walls match the axis of the nuts so that the fixing bolts fit properly.

## Sealing screw cubes and other attached parts {pagestep}
Using a syringe, apply resin around the perimeter of the screw cube so that the product is visible continuously. Apply UV light to cure the resin, ensuring that every part of the joint is covered.

>! The resin will accumulate in the chamfer of the block by capillary action. Apply a sufficient but moderate amount to ensure proper sealing.

## Positioning of peripheral elements. {pagestep}
Place the different elements in their corresponding positions and secure them with the appropriate bolts (M4, M5, and M6).

## Preparation and installation of cables {pagestep}
Using a sharp tool, make cuts in the cable pass-through rubber for each of the cables that will enter the incubator. Pass each cable through the rubber. Mount the rubber with the corresponding frame and tighten the bolts.

>! The cuts for the cables must be made in such a way that each cable is surrounded by rubber. Two perpendicular cuts must be added to allow the connectors attached to each cable to pass through.

## Closing the incubator {pagestep}
Place the rubber gasket on the frame of the incubator base. Place the lid on the gasket and close the incubator using the quick-release clamps.
