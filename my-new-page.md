## Gluing and sealing walls {pagestep}

Position the plates accordingly, ensuring a 90Â° angle between them.Using the syringe, inject the
adhesive liquid between the plates you want to join, waiting for it to bond before moving on to the next plate. Once all the plates
are bonded, use a rod to add the previously diluted acrylic to each of the joints. Ensure that the mixture covers each section of the
joints to prevent leaks.
